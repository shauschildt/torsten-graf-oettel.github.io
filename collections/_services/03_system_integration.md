text: "The answer to a seamless integration with any existing systems is here: All components of our system are API-driven and can be integrated with external systems easily. Have a content database you'd like to keep as a master? Let us show you how to push metadata updates into our system regularly. Got a rights management tool hosting your client and deal data? We can retrieve this in order to provide users on our platform with privileged access to certain titles or assets. Theoretically, you could even skip our admin interface entirely and just have your existing CRM system perform all marketing activity through our platform by sending the appropriate API calls. But you don't need to teach our language to your systems - we can also work the other way round and teach our system to talk to yours instead. The possibilities are as wide-ranging as our set of tools and features."
