text: "While our platform can easily be accessed even with mobile devices, our dedicated mobile application is purpose-built for situations such as markets or sales pitches, where predefined content packages need to be presented seamlessly and internet connectivity is not guaranteed."

subtitle_1: Your content on the go
subimage_1: /assets/img/features/details/offline-mobile_app.png
subtext_1: "Simply predefine sets of titles and videos - optionally split into groups e.g. per appointment or genre - and sync them into your tablet's or phone's offline storage. Alternatively, VOD-style ad-hoc download is available directly within our new app (released 2020). Face to face with your clients, either pitch your content using your device or connect it to a second screen."

subtitle_2: Client-facing app

subtext_2: "Our new mobile application not only covers your sales usage, but doubles as a fully-fledged VOD-style mobile solution for your clients, showcasing your catalog through an appealing app-style UI and offering ad-hoc selection of specific videos for encrypted offline storage. Either use our generic app to get started immediately, or brand it to your liking and have us deploy a custom version under a name of your choice."
