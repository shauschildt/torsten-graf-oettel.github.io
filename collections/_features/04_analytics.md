text: "Client activity is captured in real time using metrics which can be reviewed for any time range directly in the platform. Review our one-stop dashboards for a glance at overall activity and the most viewed titles and videos, or dive into deep links to any object's dedicated analytics page in order to review activity more specifically - e.g. which titles a specific user viewed or who watched the most minutes of a specific screener. Excel exports provide deeper insights, down to individual view traces, for further offline analysis and processing."

For a more specific view of activity made by clients who are allocated to a specific sales agent, a separate email report is available, as well as an optional spreadsheet attachment of video views segmenting clients by responsible sales agent."
